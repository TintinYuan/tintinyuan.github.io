            <h2>Flowers~</h2>
            <p> You always say you want flowers, and, absolutely he took note of that. Since he is not here with you, and you know your boyfriend is quite an introvert (who just don't have the courage to be too romantic in front of parents), ALSO, more importantly, in order for us to be <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly" target="_blank">ECO-FRIENDLY</a>, he eventually decided to use some digital flowres~ Hope you like them.</p>

            <h2>Also Flowers~</h2>
            <p> Remember this is the flower you gave him upon his graduation. Although he could not bring it back to his home, it remains in his heart forever.</p>
